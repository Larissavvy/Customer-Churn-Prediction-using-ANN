### Prerequisites
You must have Tensorflow,Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) installed
```
## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.
