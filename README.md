## Overview
This is a Artificial Neural Networks model for Customer Churn

1. Bank Churn: Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling
2. Telco Customer Churn : Data from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

### Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

### The data set includes information about:

    Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
    Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
    Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
    Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents



## Technical Aspect

1. Training a Artificial Neural Networks  model to predict if the customer will leave or exit the company
	- Visualization of Data
	- Feature Engineering
	- Resampling the Data
	- Using CNN for predictions

 

### Prerequisites
You must have Tensorflow,Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) installed
```
## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
